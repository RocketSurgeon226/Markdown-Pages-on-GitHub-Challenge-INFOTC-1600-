My infactuation for music has developed more and more since I was a child. I grew up listening to mostly  oldschool Hip Hop, R&B, and Gospel music. I was very captivated by the reto sounds of the past. This made me explore more genres such as, subgenresof edm like house, techno and trance, and also other forms of R&B like New Jack Swing. New Jack Swing, developed in the late 80s and early 90s, was an amalagmation of Hip Hop, R&B, Funk, Pop, and Jazz.

Here are examples:
