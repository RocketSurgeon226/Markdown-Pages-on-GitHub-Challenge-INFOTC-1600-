## Music

My infatuation with music has developed more and more since I was a child. I grew up listening to mostly oldschool **Hip** **Hop**, **R&B**, and **Gospel** music. Throughout middle and high school I was very captivated by the retro sounds of the past. This made me explore more genres such as, subgenres of _**EDM**_ like **House**, **Techno** and **Trance**, and also other forms of _**R&B**_ like **New Jack Swing**. New Jack Swing, developed in the late 80s and early 90s, was an amalagmation of Hip Hop, R&B, Funk, Pop, and Jazz.

Here are examples:

_**Techno/Trance/House**_
