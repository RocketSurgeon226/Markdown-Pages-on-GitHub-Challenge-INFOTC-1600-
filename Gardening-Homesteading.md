## Gardening

* _Watermelon_  
* _Cucumbers_  
* _Chile_ _Peppers_  
* _Romaine_ _lettuce_  
* and _Corn_  

## Homesteading

During and after my internship with ___Bayer___ this past summer, I have developed a fondness for **homesteading**; wanting to live on and own my own land in a quite and peaceful place away from overpopulated cities and suburbia. Also I on this land I want to grow my own crops and hunt my own food.
